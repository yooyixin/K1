what is this?
eveything in this page i cannot understand rightly.

this is a sadly story.

but at least one thing make me happy that i can seemly use some easy word to express some thing.

this is a very short happy until my friend say some people can do that better even they just study English for one or two days.
he must be a fake friend.

ok,
i will tell you the whole story.
first, i need to study lots of things including knowelage ,some skills of handle up data and et al.
most of them need use my English, and do i have to tell you the levle of my English again? that is really Terrible.
uh...let's go on.
then i need find it out ,which can help me to learn what i need or want to learn.
this is so colorful cyberspace.
i can know how the website was built by php or markdown , how to make a project use python...
everything is interesting!

next i think i need to write a blog to denote my study process.
that is a good idea because i can write a web page!
so cool!

and the next story i think you well know.
i find the github.com that i can nearly find everything which can help my study.
but the website use English to dispaly that make me so upset...

need i tell you the reason again?
HEY, YOU!
CLOSE THE WEBSITE NOW!
AND NEVER OPEN IT ANGIN!
